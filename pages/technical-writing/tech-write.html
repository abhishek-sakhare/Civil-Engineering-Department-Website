                    <p>1. <b>Numerical Modeling of Flow Pattern at a Right-angled
                        River Bend Using CCHE2D Model </b><br> <br>Animesh Das (PhD scholar) <br>
                        Dr. Sushant Kumar Biswal (Supervisor) 
                        
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>In this study, the CCHE2D model is used to analyse the flow pattern in a
                        meander reach of the Gomati River. The finite volume method is used by the
                        numerical model to solve the depth-averaged two-dimensional equations
                        with k - e turbulence closure. The numerical findings were compared with
                        field data for two different flow rates in order to calibrate the CCHE2D model
                        using various Manning's roughness coefficients. The results show that for the
                        minimum and maximum discharges, a smaller Manning's roughness factor
                        (0.015 ≥ Ā ≥ 0.025) is more favorable to a higher Manning's roughness factor
                        (0.030 ≤ Ā ≤ 0.040). The results of the numerical model demonstrated that
                        fluctuations in hydraulic parameters including shear stress, velocity, flow
                        depth, and Froude number in the river bend are greatly influenced by the
                        existence of centrifugal force and helical cells. The linear relationship
                        between velocity and shear stress is presented across the whole study reach,
                        as indicated by the R-square and linear correlation coefficient (r)
                        components. The results of the model show that the flow field within the river
                        bend can be accurately simulated by the computational model.

                        <ul>
                            <p>The key
                                findings of the research such as: </p>
                            <li>The Manning’s roughness coefficient ranges of 0.030–0.040 will have
                                better results, and for medium and high discharges, the roughness
                                coefficient ranges of 0.015–0.025 provide the more accurate result. </li>
                            <li>
                                The analysis suggests that the water surface and the maximum velocities
                                in the river arch develop toward the outer bank. The simulation results also
                                indicate that, on average, the average velocity for the discharges of 68
                                m^3/s and 102 m^3/s in the study reach is 0.56 and 0.77 m/s, respectively. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Moreover, the average shear stress for the two discharges mentioned
                                above is 27.99 and 35.62 N/m², respectively. 

                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                The results of the study show that the CCHE2D model has the ability to
                                simulate the complex rivers with varying river morphology. Therefore, in
                                the engineering and operational projects of the Gomati River, the results
                                of this numerical model can be trusted and used.

                        Dr. Animesh Debnath (Supervisor)     
                    </p>
                    <p>In recent decades, industrial wastewater discharge containing toxic or
                        hazardous manufactured dyes has risen tremendously, creating a serious
                        environmental threat. A new hybrid adsorbent, PANI@Fe–Mn–Zr synthesized
                        by mixing Fe–Mn–Zr metal oxide composite with polyaniline (PANI), was used
                        to study methyl red (MR) dye removal from aqueous solution. The crystalline
                        nature, surface characteristics, and shape of produced nanoparticles were
                        investigated using different characterization techniques such as energy
                        dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray
                        diffraction (XRD) pattern, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis and Fourier
                        transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The conceptual framework of anionic dye
                        ion sorption onto manufactured nanomaterials was investigated using kinetic
                        and isotherm analyses. Using experimental data on adsorption, mathematical
                        models based on response surface methodology (RSM) were designed to
                        analyse adsorption behavior for correct assessment of MR dye removal
                        efficiencies. Natural water and real wastewater samples were employed to
                        observe the extant of interferences in MR dye uptake capacity with respect
                        to blank or controlled samples. Finally, the performance of the PANI@Fe–Mn–
                        Zr was evaluated by comparing with other studies where several kinds of
                        adsorbents have been used to remove different dye pollutants. The
                        adsorption process was observed to be influenced by the sonication time,
                        dose of PANI@Fe–Mn–Zr, and initial concentration of MR dye.

                                dose, 15 min of sonication, and pH 7.0, the maximum MR dye adsorption
                                efficiency of 90.34% was achieved. </li>

                                Kinetic analysis was performed using five different kinetic models, which
                                shows that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model had the best fit
                                among the five models. The Langmuir isotherm best fits the adsorption
                                experiments at pH 7.0, yielding a significant MR dye uptake capacity of
                                434.78 mgg-1.

                                obtained at contact time of 12 min, initial MR dye concentration of 15 mg/L

                    <p>Ground response analysis describes the free-field response of soil deposit to
                        an input ground motion which is used to analyze the instability of soil deposit
                        and surface mounted structures. This paper presents a study of such
                        response of dry uniform soil deposit on bed rock subjected to sinusoidal
                        motion of significant frequency range comparable with typical seismic
                        recordings at geotechnical engineering laboratory, NIT Agartala. For this a
                        series of single-axis shake table tests were carried out on uniform dry silty
                        clay, sand and gravel model subjecting sinusoidal motion of suitable
                        frequency ranges. The length to height ratio of the laboratory soil model was
                        kept about 1.71 for shake table tests. The models were prepared by dry
                        pluviation technique. The height and rate of pluviation were adjusted
                        accordingly to achieve the target relative density of the soil model. An
                        assessment of the one dimensional ground response analysis has been
                        carried out for similar characteristics soil column model subjected to
                        identical ground motion using DEEPSOIL v7.0.<br><br>
                        The result obtained from the shake table tests shows the influence of
                        frequency on response of soil model and the variation of strength and
                        displacement parameters at different depth. These results have been
                        compared with the DEEPSOIL assessment to show the relative difference of
                        the parameters to express the cyclic response of dry uniform soil deposit.
